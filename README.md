**COVID-PORTFOLIO-PROJECT**

This project  dataset is used to analyse the  global data about covid_19 patients.

This project uses two dataset CovidDeaths.xlsx and CovidVaccinations.xlsx which have been cleaned in excel and loaded to mssql for data exploration.

**The files used;**

~**CovidDeaths.xlsx**- the dataset contains information on Covid-19 deaths worldwide

~**CovidVaccinations.xlsx**- the dataset contains information on Covid-19 vaccinations worldwide

~**Data Exploration.sql** - the SQL code used to explore the data in the database

~**Tableau Visualization.sql** - the SQL code used to visualize the dataset after exploration.

**skilles used include;**

JOINS, AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS, CTE'S, WINDOWS FUNCTIONS, TEMP TABLES, CONVERTING DATATYPES, CREATING VIEWS

**data exploration in SQL**

The COVID_19_PORTFOLIO PROJECT.SQL file contains SQL queries used to explore the covid 19 data.
The sql queries are used to analyse and explore the COVID DATA for a data analysis project.I used mssql to write the codes and tableu for visualizing the data.
The first two quries are use to select and order data from CovidDeaths and CovidVaccinations tables
The next queries we are looking at the death percentage based on;
  1. total_cases and total_deaths showing what percentage of population got covid.
  2. The countries that have the highest infection rate compared to the population.
  3. Looking countries with highest deathcount per population
  4. The last query breaking down the death counts by continent to provide a more global view of the COVID 19 pandemic.
  5. 
**THE QUERIES ARE AS FOLLOWS:**
